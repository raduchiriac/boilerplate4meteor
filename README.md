## My Meteor Boilerplate

This is how I start my meteor projects

> Since this is still a work in progress, check the
> probably better looking boilerplate here: [https://github.com/Differential/meteor-boilerplate](https://github.com/Differential/meteor-boilerplate) or
> if you love your terminal and `iron:router` check out the awesome [iron CLI](https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-cli).

If you are still curious, you'd maybe wanna start by doing:

- `$ git clone https://github.com/raduchiriac/boilerplate4meteor.git`
- `$ mv boilerplate4meteor/ my_new_meteor_project` — to start a new hack based on this repo
- `$ rm -rf .git && git init` — to init your own Git
- `$ meteor update` — to update to the latest packages
- `$ cp settings_sample.json settings.json` — in case you have API secret keys and you want to run `meteor --settings settings.json`
