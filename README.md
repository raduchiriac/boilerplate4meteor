## Personal boilerplate for my Meteor apps

> Work in progress...
> Probably this is a better boilerplate

You'd maybe start by doing

- `git clone https://github.com/raduchiriac/boilerplate4meteor.git`
- `mv boilerplate4meteor/ my_new_meteor_project` to start a new hack based on this repo
- `rm -rf .git && git init` to init your own Git
- `meteor update` to get the latest packages
- `cp settings_sample.json settings.json` in case you want to run `meteor --settings settings.json`
